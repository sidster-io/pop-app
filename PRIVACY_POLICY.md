# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 14, 2024

Pop (the "App") is committed to maintaining the privacy and protection of your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines how Pop handles and safeguards any data collected or transmitted through the App.

1. **Information Collection and Use**

Pop does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from users of the App. We do not require any registration, login, or personal identification to access and utilize the App's features.

1. **Data Transmission**

Pop does not transmit any data, including personal information, to external servers or third-party services. All data generated and processed within the App remains on your device and is not shared with any external entities. When you enable iCloud Personal in Settings, your clipboard data is transmitted to your own personal iCloud Drive hosted by Apple and Pop developers do not have access to this information or liable for any breach.

1. **Third-Party Services**

The App does not integrate with any third-party services, including analytics tools or advertising platforms. As a result, no data is shared with external parties during the use of the App.

1. **Children's Privacy**

Pop does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. The App is intended for general audiences and is not directed towards children. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately at sid@boldstroke.co.

1. **Security**

We take reasonable precautions to protect any information collected within the App from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure, and Pop cannot guarantee absolute data security.

1. **Changes to the Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App's features or legal requirements. We will notify users of any significant changes by updating the Effective Date stated at the beginning of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.

1. **Contact Us**

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the App's data handling practices, please contact us at sid@boldstroke.co.

By using Pop, you agree to the terms outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please refrain from using the App.
